## Project Name:

- Learning NFTs

#### Summary

Learning NFTs is an application that helps educate and onboard both users and developers into The Blockchain Ecosystem. Companies and creators will be able to create new quizzes and projects. Users will be able to learn and earn tokens, experience points and practical knowledge.

#### What it does

Defi is a revolutionary and ever-expanding space that is still widely unknown to the masses. There are problems with Defi applications:

- High entry barrier: tech-intensive, major projects are not user-friendly
- Scattered information: learning required intensive research
- Inefficient user acquisition: masses are not incentivized enough to learn, participate, and contribute to the Defi ecosystem.

This is why we‚Äôve built Learning NFTs. Learning NFTs is an on-chain quests platform built for all blockchains where users can engage in on-chain tasks called and be rewarded for doing so with token rewards, NFT completion badges, and experience points on the platform.

We believe Learning NFTs will help:

- Onboard new users into web3
- Increase user engagement during current market conditions from existing users
- Help educate anyone about the ecosystem through hands-on on-chain experiences.

We also want to incentivize learners and builders by rewarding them with NFTs using Gelato‚Äôs Gasless Wallet SDK for creating tasks and minting NFTs for users who answer correctly quizzes.

### What's next for Learning NFTs

We would like to keep working on:
Adding more incentives for creators and users
Verify users using the WorldCoin protocol
Find partnerships to launch officially
Build a better responsive UI
Add testing and monitoring our smart contract

### How it's made

We are using React, next js in the front end, and Gelato One Click Wallet in order on board and to log in new users. We are also, using Gelato‚Äôs Gasless Wallet SDK for creating tasks and minting NFTs for users who answer correctly quizzes.
In the backend, it's mainly Solidity, Openzepelin, Mumbai & Goerli Network, NodeJS, TypeScript, and GraphQL. We are querying data from the Flow Network. We're storing that data in IPFS

### How to run Flow Learning Resources

```sh
cd 0-hello-world
npm install
npm run dev
```

## For DEMO Purposes:

##### Executor Operators

In this track dedicated to Gelato, we will get much deeper into Gelato's concepts and also build on it!

# What is an Executor?

- Executors are Gelato Network participants who provide infrastructure as a service to execute transactions as instructed by users of the Gelato Network.
  An Executor is a movie
  An Executor is a song

# How Executors do they work?

- Executors receive tasks to be executed via the network Checkers & performs a simulation and if the simulation does well, submits the transaction on chain, checks for its inclusion on every new block, and, in case of a task execution needing a resubmission, the Executor is responsible for bumping the gas price and re-submitting it.
  Executors do not work
  Executors are unemployed

* Descrip: In this track dedicated to Flow, we will get much deeper into Flow's concepts and also build on it!

What is Flow?

- Proof of Stake
  Sharding
  Data Availability

Flow is what kind of blockchain?
Layer 0

- Layer 1
  Layer 2
  Layer 3

What are the four phases Flow split the miner/validator role into?
Collection - Retention - Execution - Verification
Collection - Consensus - Expectation - Validation

- Collection - Consensus - Execution - Verification

- What is Gelato Network?
  Gelato is a tool to build automation into dapps and thus level them up to a whole new range of cool features and User Experiences.
  Gelato is an icecream
  Gelato is a coffee
  Gelato is a book

- What is an example of an automated dapp? üç¶
  Amazon Store
  Automatically refinance my loan between multiple lending protocols to always get the highest yield.
  Walmart Store
  Costco Store

- How Gelato works?
  It works by running node in Etherum
  It doens't run
  At its core, Gelato is a network of relay nodes (executors), which User's can instruct to submit arbitrary transactions (Actions) on their behalf, when certain predefined Conditions are met.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
